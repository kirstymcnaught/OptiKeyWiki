OptiKey should work on a Windows pc/laptop/tablet that is capable of running the .Net 4.5 Framework (*this does ***not** include Windows RT tablets*), which should be any version of Windows from Vista SP2 up to Windows 10. 

Your device should be relatively modern/capable, but high end computer specs are not required by OptiKey.

**N.B.** If you are using an eye tracking device your pc/laptop/tablet will need to meet the minimum requirements of your eye tracker's software. These are typically more than enough for OptiKey to run flawlessly.
