*Other windows are not re-sized correctly when arranging them horizontally or vertically around OptiKey*

When arranging other windows horizontally or vertically you may sometimes notice that a window is positioned correctly, but is not re-sized as you would expect. This is due to a restriction on the other window which prevents it from being made smaller than a specific width/height. Unfortunately there is nothing I can do about this as these restrictions are beyond my control.

*The Start ("Metro") screen in Windows 8 is being re-sized by the arrange horizontally/vertically key*

This is intentional and will be reverted automatically when you exit OptiKey. You can optionally maximise the Start screen again from within OptiKey from the Position menu by selecting the 'Arrange Maximised' key. See [Size & Position](https://github.com/JuliusSweetland/OptiKey/wiki/Size-&-position) for more.
