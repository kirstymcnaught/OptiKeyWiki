Two things need to happen for the Management Console to open;

1. OptiKey must have focus - it will be highlighted on the taskbar when it has focus, but if you are unsure just click on OptiKey to focus it.

2. Press the 'ALT' key and the 'P' key at the same time - to do this hold down 'ALT' and then press 'P' once.
If the console is still not opening then check that OptiKey is not currently simulating key strokes by checking whether the Simulate Key Strokes key is locked down (see ['Simulate a physical keyboard'](https://github.com/JuliusSweetland/OptiKey/wiki/User-Guide#simulate-a-physical-keyboard) for more). If it is locked down, then you may have a modifier key pressed which is interfering with you pressing ALT + M. Either release any down modifier keys (Shift, Ctrl, Win, or Alt), or release the Simulate Key Strokes key and try again.
