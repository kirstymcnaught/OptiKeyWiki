At some point you'll probably want to type a number, symbol, or diactrical letter (e.g. an accented e). For the numbers and symbols keyboard select the Symbols key:

There are too many symbols to fit on one screen (in fact there are 3 screens of symbols). You can toggle between the screens by selecing the keyboard number key, which progresses to the next keyboard and then loops back to the first again:

![3 of 3 key](http://juliussweetland.github.io/OptiKey/images/Key_Symbol_3of3_Up.png)

At any time you can select the Alpha key to go back to the main (A-Z letters) keyboard:

If you want diacritical letters or currency symbols select the Menu key and then the diacritic key (#3 on the menu keyboard) or currency key (#4 on the menu keyboard):

Again, there are more diacritical characters or currency symbols than it is possible to fit on one screen, so use the "1 of X", "2 of X" keys to move between the screens. As before, the Alpha key on each of those keyboards takes you back to the letters keyboard.
