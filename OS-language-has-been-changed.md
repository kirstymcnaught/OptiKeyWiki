*OS language has been changed*

After using OptiKey you discover that your operating system language has changed, e.g. you were using English UK keyboard layout, but now your keyboard layout is French. Why has this happened?! Well OptiKey does not (and actually can not) change your OS language, but there are built in shortcuts in Windows 8/8.1/10 (and possibly other versions) which switch between your installed OS languages. These are typically SHIFT+ALT or WIN+SPACE. As OptiKey often automatically presses the SHIFT key, and ALT+M is the shortcut to open the Management Console it becomes easy to accidentally press SHIFT+ALT and thus switch the OS language. This behaviour is on by default, but the shortcut can be disabled by following these steps:

1. Open the Control Panel
2. Click on "Clock, Language, and Region"
3. Click on "Language"
4. Click on "Advanced Settings"
5. Click on "Change language bar hot keys"
6. You should see a list of "Actions" and "Key sequences" - select the relevant actions and click on "Change Key Sequence" to change it to "Not Assigned" for both "Switch Input Language" and "Switch Keyboard Layout".
