**Edit the dictionary from the Management Console**

The default dictionary contains many common words and phrases, but you will probably want to customise it by adding and removing entries. You can view and customise the dictionary from the Management Console:

1. Open OptiKey's Management Console (with OptiKey focussed press ALT + M) and select the "Dictionary" tab.

2. To add a new word or phrase type it (as a lower case word unless it is a proper noun, abbreviation, etc) in the box at the top (#1 in the screenshot) and click 'Add' to add it to the dictionary.

3. To remove an entry just click the 'Delete' button next to it (#2 in the screenshot).

4. Click 'OK' to save your changes.

**Edit the dictionary from the scratchpad**

You can also add words and phrases directly from the scratchpad by pressing the Add To Dictionary key. OptiKey will examine the words and sentences that you have already typed into the scratchpad and ask you which you would like to add to the dictionary:

1. Type the word to add on its own, or as part of a sentence.

2. Select the Add To Dictionary key.

3. OptiKey will find all words in the scratchpad which are not already in the dictionary and ask you, one at a time, if you would like to add the word. Confirm to add to the dictionary.

To add a phrase it is very similar:

1. Clear the scratchpad using the Clear key:

    ![Clear key](http://juliussweetland.github.io/OptiKey/images/Key_Clear_Up.png)

2. Type the phrase exactly as you would like it to be available in the dictionary. You don't need to capitalise the first letter unless it is a proper noun as OptiKey will auto capitalise the first letter if it is the start of a new sentence (if that setting is turned on - see [Auto-capitalisation](https://github.com/JuliusSweetland/OptiKey/wiki/User-Guide#auto-capitalisation-and-auto-spacing) for more).

3. Select the Add To Dictionary key.

4. Confirm to add the phrase when asked. OptiKey will also ask you if you would like to add any new words that appear in your phrase - choose to confirm if the word is useful, or skip if not.
