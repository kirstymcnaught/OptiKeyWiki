*When I try to install or run OptiKey on Windows 8 (or above) I see a Smart Screen warning saying that OptiKey is an unrecognised and potentially dangerous application.*

Due to the fact that OptiKey is a new application Windows will consider it an unknown entity for a little while and warn people installing it that it may not be trustworthy. Don't worry - it doesn't mean that the installer you are using has been compromised. Click "MORE INFO" and then "RUN ANYWAY" and the installation/run will continue normally. I expect this warning to go away as OptiKey matures and Windows starts recognising it as a "safe" application.

*When I try to download, install or run OptiKey my virus scanner complains that OptiKey may be a virus*

It isn't. Some overly zealous virus scanners mistake the keyboard simulation logic in OptiKey for a keylogger, but there is no nasty stuff in the code (which is all available anyway as the project is 100% open-source).
