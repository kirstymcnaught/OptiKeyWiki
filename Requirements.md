**Which devices/operating systems are supported?**

OptiKey should work on any Windows pc/laptop/tablet running at least Windows Vista (the following should be fine; Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows 8.1 and the upcoming Windows 10). The pc/laptop/tablet should be relatively modern, but high end specs are not required.
