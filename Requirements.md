OptiKey should work on a Windows pc/laptop/tablet that is capable of running the .Net 4.5 Framework, which should be any version of Windows from Vista SP2 up to Windows 8.1. The pc/laptop/tablet should be relatively modern, but high end specs are not required.

* [TheEyeTribe](http://theeyetribe.com/)
* [ITU GazeTracker](http://sourceforge.net/projects/gazetrackinglib/)
* [Tobii EyeX (coming soon)](http://www.tobii.com/en/eye-experience/eyex/)
* [Tobii REX (coming soon)](http://www.tobii.com/en/eye-experience/buy/buy-rex/)

OptiKey is designed to be used with an eye tracker, but you do not need one. You can control OptiKey with a standard mouse if you want to try it out.

Adding support for new eye trackers is fairly straightforward. If you have an unsupported tracker then get in touch and I can attempt to add support for it: [optikeyfeedback@gmail.com](mailto:optikeyfeedback@gmail.com)
