##<a name="device-os-requirements">Supported devices & operating systems</a>

OptiKey should work on any Windows pc/laptop/tablet that is capable of running the .Net 4.5 Framework, which should be any version of Windows from Vista SP2 onwards. I believe this is the current list:

* Windows Vista, Service Pack 2
* Windows 7
* Windows 8
* Windows 8.1
* Windows 8.1, Update 1
* Windows Server 2008, Service Pack 2
* Windows Server 2008 R2, Service Pack 1
* Windows Home Server 2011
* Windows Server 2012
* Windows Server 2012 R2
* and anything later, including Windows 10...

The pc/laptop/tablet should be relatively modern, but high end specs are not required.

Adding new input devices is fairly straightforward. If you have an unsupported tracker then get in touch and I can attempt to add support for it: [optikeyfeedback@gmail.com](mailto:optikeyfeedback@gmail.com)
