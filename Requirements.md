OptiKey should work on any Windows pc/laptop/tablet running at least Windows Vista (the following should be fine; Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows 8.1 and the upcoming Windows 10). The pc/laptop/tablet should be relatively modern, but high end specs are not required.

Adding new input devices is fairly straightforward. If you have an unsupported tracker then get in touch and I can attempt to add support for it; [optikeyfeedback@gmail.com](mailto:optikeyfeedback@gmail.com)
