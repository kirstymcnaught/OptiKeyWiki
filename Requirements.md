OptiKey should work on a Windows pc/laptop/tablet that is capable of running the .Net 4.5 Framework, which should be any version of Windows from Vista SP2 up to Windows 8.1. Your device should be relatively modern/capable, but very high end specs are not required by OptiKey. 

**N.B.** If you are using an eye tracking device your pc/laptop/tablet will need to meet the minimum requirements of your eye tracker's software. These are typically more than enough for OptiKey to run flawlessly.

OptiKey is designed to be used with an eye tracker, but you do not need one. You can control OptiKey with a standard mouse if you want to try it out.

Adding support for new eye trackers is fairly straightforward. If you have an unsupported tracker then get in touch and I can attempt to add support for it: [optikeyfeedback@gmail.com](mailto:optikeyfeedback@gmail.com)
