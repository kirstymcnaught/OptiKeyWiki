A lot of AAC (alternative and augmentative communication) products on the market are outrageously expensive, which I think is hugely unfair. Everyone with motor and speech limitations should have access to suitable software. OptiKey is my contribution to help make this possible.

I hope you like it as much as I've enjoyed working on it.
