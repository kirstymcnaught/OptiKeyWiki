**Progressing to use an eye tracking device...**

1. You will need a computer/laptop/tablet that meets the minimum requirements of your chosen eye tracker. Very broadly speaking you will need at least an Intel i5 processor, at least one USB 3.0 port (USB 2.0 will not work with most tracking devices) and a screen size large enough to be used comfortably (13-15" minimum) and no more than 24" (although it may be possible to use a larger screen if Windows is limited to only cover 24", e.g. when using Parallels to run Windows on a Mac).*

2. Purchase one of the low cost eye tracking devices. I would recommend the [Tobii EyeX tracker](http://www.tobii.com/en/eye-experience/buy/) or [Eye Tribe tracker](https://theeyetribe.com/products/)

3. [Follow these steps](https://github.com/JuliusSweetland/OptiKey/wiki/Using-eye-trackers) which guide you through the process of setting up your tracker to work with OptiKey.

4. Have fun controlling your computer and speaking using only your eyes.

5. Drop me a message to let me know how well OptiKey is working for you. Your feedback is invaluable.
