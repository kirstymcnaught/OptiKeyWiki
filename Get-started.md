If after trying OptiKey using your mouse you would like to try using it with an eye tracker, then the general steps and requirements are:

1. You will need a computer/laptop/tablet that meets the minimum requirements of your chosen eye tracker. You may already own one, but double check that the specs meet the requirements of your chosen eye tracker. Very broadly speaking these are an Intel i5 processor with a decent amount of ram, at least one USB 3.0 port (USB 2.0 will not work with most tracking devices) and a screen size of no more than 24" (although it may be possible to use a larger screen if Windows is limited to only cover 24", e.g. when using Parallels to run Windows on a Mac). If your computer/laptop/tablet meets the requirements of your eye tracking device it should be fine to run OptiKey as the requirements to run OptiKey are relatively low.

**N.B.** If you are unsure which computer/laptop/tablet to purchase please email me - I'm not a hardware expert, but I can offer advice as I've found there to be a sweet spot that balances screen size, power and price (e.g. I think the Microsoft Surface range is excellent, but the screen size is a little too small and the price tag too high for this use case). If you are buying a new computer/laptop/tablet then there are viable options that start at around £250-£300.

2. Purchase one of the low cost eye tracking devices. I would recommend the [Tobii EyeX tracker](http://www.tobii.com/en/eye-experience/buy/) or [Eye Tribe tracker](https://theeyetribe.com/products/)

3. [Follow these steps](https://github.com/JuliusSweetland/OptiKey/wiki/Using-eye-trackers) which guide you through the process of setting up your tracker to work with OptiKey.

4. Have fun controlling your computer and speaking with your eyes.

5. Drop me a message to let me know how well OptiKey is working for you. Your feedback is invaluable.
