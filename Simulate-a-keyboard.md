Typing words into the "scratchpad" is great if you only want OptiKey to speak, but you can also use OptiKey to simulate keystrokes on a physical keyboard and type into other applications.

1. To get started clear the scratchpad by selecting the Clear key:

2. Select the Simulate Key Strokes key to turn keystroke simulation on (the key will stay locked down until you decide you want to release it by selecting it again):

3. Focus another application where you would like to begin typing, e.g. type a letter into Microsoft Word, or an email into Gmail. You can focus the other application by using a physical mouse to select it and bring it to the foreground, or use OptiKey to simulate the mouse selection (see ['Simulating a physical mouse'](https://github.com/JuliusSweetland/OptiKey/wiki/User-Guide#simulate-a-physical-mouse)).

4. Select keys to type as usual. As you make each selection it will appear in both the scratchpad and your selected application. The BackOne and BackMany keys can be used to correct any mistakes (introduced in the ['Type your first word'](https://github.com/JuliusSweetland/OptiKey/wiki/User-Guide#type-your-first-word) section).

You may have also noticed that some new keys are available now that the Simulate Key Strokes key is pressed, for example the Shift, Ctrl, Win and Alt keys:

![Shift key](http://juliussweetland.github.io/OptiKey/images/Key_Shift_Up.png)
![Ctrl key](http://juliussweetland.github.io/OptiKey/images/Key_Ctrl_Up.png)
![Win key](http://juliussweetland.github.io/OptiKey/images/Key_Win_Up.png)
![Alt key](http://juliussweetland.github.io/OptiKey/images/Key_Alt_Up.png)

These work in exactly the same way as they do on a physical keyboard, and can be combined with other keys by holding them down. Try selecting one of them and you'll notice that it cycles through 3 states; UP, DOWN, and LOCKED DOWN, before returning to UP. For example, the Shift key progresses like this:

![Shift key](http://juliussweetland.github.io/OptiKey/images/Key_Shift_Up.png)
 ⇨

 ⇨ 
![Shift key](http://juliussweetland.github.io/OptiKey/images/Key_Shift_Up.png)
etc...

This makes it easy to press or lock down a number of keys together. For example, select Ctrl to press it down, and then press the "P" key to send the "Print" command to the active application. The Ctrl key will be automatically released after you select the "P" key, unless it is in the LOCKED DOWN state.

It is a good idea to check if any of these "modifier" keys (Shift, Ctrl, Win, Alt) are pressed if you experience unexpected behaviour while typing into another application as they can impact your key selections.

There is also a new keyboard available to you if the Simulate Key Strokes key is pressed; the 'Physical' keyboard (#5 on the menu keyboard), which you'll find by selecting the Menu key. This keyboard contains all the other keyboard keys we've not covered yet, such as ESCAPE, INSERT, ARROW KEYS, FUNCTION KEYS, etc.
