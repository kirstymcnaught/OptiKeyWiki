This is an open source project and I would love for there to be a community of volunteers around OptiKey. I have a list the length of my arm with ideas, features and improvements. Here's a sample;

* Add support for more languages (dictionaries, as well as localising OptiKey)
* Improve the algorithms which matches multi-key selections to dictionary words
* Add incorrect spelling tolerance and correction
* Add next word suggestions
* Support for accessible buttons, sip/puff tubes, brain potential detection, and lots of other human interfaces
* and lots more...

If you are interested in helping to push this project forward please email me at [optikeyfeedback@gmail.com](mailto:optikeyfeedback@gmail.com), or if you are a software dev please take a look at the current set of issues on the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/JuliusSweetland/OptiKey/issues).

Thank you!
