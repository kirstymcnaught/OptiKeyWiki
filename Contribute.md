This is an open source project and I would love for there to be a community of volunteers around OptiKey. Email me at [optikeyfeedback@gmail.com](mailto:optikeyfeedback@gmail.com).

I have a list the length of my arm with ideas, features and improvements. Here's a sample;
* Add support for more languages (dictionaries, as well as localising OptiKey)
* Improve the algorithms which matches multi-key selections to dictionary words
* Add word completion / incorrect spelling suggestions
* Add next word suggestions
* Support for accessible buttons, sip/puff tubes, brain potential detection, and lots of other human interfaces
* and lots more...
