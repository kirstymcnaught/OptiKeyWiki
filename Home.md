OptiKey is an assistive on-screen keyboard which runs on Windows. It is designed to be used with a low cost eye-tracking device to bring keyboard control, mouse control and speech to people with motor and speech limitations, such as people living with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) / Motor Neuron Disease (MND).

It works out of the box once you have your eye-tracking device installed and allows selections to be made using dwell selection, as well as physical buttons and assistive devices. If you do not have an eye tracking device you can use OptiKey with a mouse or your webcam.

OptiKey was written to challenge the outrageously expensive, unreliable and difficult to use AAC (alternative and augmentative communication) products on the market. It is, therefore, fully open-source and free. Forever.

OptiKey can be used as an alternative to a physical keyboard, allowing you to type into any application. OptiKey can automatically insert spaces between words and capitalise letters for you to increase your typing rate. You can even type whole words and phrases in a single selection by "swiping" or using "auto-complete".

OptiKey can replace your mouse, allowing you to click, scroll and drag with precision anywhere on screen.

To communicate naturally with those around you select the 'Speak' key and OptiKey will convert what you have typed into speech.
