OptiKey is an assistive on-screen keyboard which runs on Windows. It is designed to be used with an eye-tracking device to bring keyboard control, mouse control and speech to people with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) / Motor Neuron Disease (MND).

It works out of the box once you have your eye-tracking device installed and allows selections to be made using dwell selection, as well as physical buttons and assistive devices. If you do not have an eye tracking device you can use OptiKey with a mouse.

OptiKey is fully open-source and free. Forever.

Type quickly using the "swiping" and word completion features. OptiKey will automatically insert spaces between words and capitalise letters for you. You can even type whole phrases in a single selection.

OptKey can be used as a complete replacement for your physical keyboard and mouse, allowing you to type and click anywhere. It can also generate speech.

It is themable and can be extended to support custom layouts, custom behaviour and new/customised languages.
