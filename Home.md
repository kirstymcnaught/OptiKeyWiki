OptiKey is an assistive on-screen keyboard which runs on Windows. It was designed to be used with an eye-tracking device to bring keyboard control, mouse control and speech to people with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) / Motor Neuron Disease (MND).

The software includes a huge set of characters and symbols, support for word prediction and “swiping”, and a lot of customisable features such as visual themes, keyboard size, position, etc. It works out of the box once you have your eye-tracking device installed and allows selections to be made using physical buttons, dwell selection, etc. If you do not have an eye tracking device you can use OptiKey with a mouse.

OptiKey can be downloaded for free and is fully open-source.

It is designed to be a complete replacement for your physical keyboard and mouse and has been built to support interaction from assistive input devices (eye-tracking devices, sip/puff tubes, brain-computer interfaces, assistive buttons, etc), as well as standard input device (mouse, keyboard, microphone). The aim of OptiKey is to give everyone the ability to fully interact with a computer and communicate freely.

OptiKey can be used to simulate a physical keyboard (so you can type into your favourite applications), simulate mouse interactions (so you can click on links, scroll around documents, etc), as well as speak out loud.

It is themable and can be extended to support custom layouts, custom behaviour and new/customised languages.
