It is designed to be a complete replacement for your physical keyboard and mouse and has been built to support interaction from assistive input devices (eye-tracking devices, sip/puff tubes, brain-computer interfaces, assistive buttons, etc), as well as standard input device (mouse, keyboard, microphone). The aim of OptiKey is to give everyone the ability to fully interact with a computer and communicate freely.

OptiKey can be used to simulate a physical keyboard (so you can type into your favourite applications), simulate mouse interactions (so you can click on links, scroll around documents, etc), as well as speak out loud.
