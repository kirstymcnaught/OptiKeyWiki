A British voice actor called Rich has very kindly created and donated his voice for use with OptiKey. The TTS voice was created using ModelTalker.org (you can read more about [voice banking here](https://github.com/OptiKey/OptiKey/wiki/Voice-banking)).

To download Rich's voice (British English) log in to [https://www.modeltalker.org/get-your-voice](https://www.modeltalker.org/get-your-voice) with the username **Rich** with password **ModelTalker** (note both are case sensitive).

Thank you Rich!
