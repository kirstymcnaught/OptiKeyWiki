You can put OptiKey to sleep while you take a rest or do something else by selecting the 'Sleep' key (available on most keyboards and from the menu):

1. Select the 'Menu' key:

The 'Sleep' key can be toggled on and off by selecting it. When the 'Sleep' key is pressed down no other key will respond to you until the 'Sleep' key is selected (released):
