1. Voice: The voice to use when OptiKey speaks the contents of the scratchpad. The available set of voices depends on which TTS (Text To Speech) voices you have installed in Windows. Additional voices can be installed from the Microsoft website, or purchased through 3rd party companies. Please email me at optikeyfeedback@gmail.com if you are unsure how to do this, or would like to share a good source of voices.

2. Volume: The volume of speech within OptiKey.

3. Rate: The rate (speed) at which the scratchpad text is spoken. From -10 to +10 (slower to faster).
