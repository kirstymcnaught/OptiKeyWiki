1. Make key selections to type some text into the "scratchpad" (the area at the top of the OptiKey keyboard).

2. Select the Speak key (it will turn blue while the speech is being read out):

3. If you want to stop the in-progress speech at any time select the Speak key again (while it is still blue). This is useful if you accidentally intruct OptiKey to speak before you are ready and the "scratchpad" has a lot of text.

4. The voice, rate of speech and volume are all changeable from the Management Console (with OptiKey focussed press ALT + M). 

*Which voices you can choose depends on which voices are installed in your copy of Windows. Please google for instructions on how to add new voices as the method varies for each version of Windows.*
