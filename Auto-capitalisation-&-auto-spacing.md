OptiKey can help to increase your typing rate by working out if your next word is the start of a new sentence and automatically pressing the Shift key for you to capitalise the next letter. This works when typing letter by letter, as well as typing whole words using multikey selection.

OptiKey can further speeds things up by automatically inserting spaces between words and sentences. This works best when using multi-key selection to enter whole words and phrases.

*Both of these features are turned ON by default, but can be toggled on or off from the 'Words' tab of the Management Console. See [Word settings](https://github.com/JuliusSweetland/OptiKey/wiki/Word-settings) for more.*
