If you would like to return OptiKey to the state it is in when you first install it (all settings back to their original factory values), delete all of the **directories** that start with **"OptiKey.exe_"** in your roaming app data directory (C:\Users\YOUR_USER_NAME\AppData\Roaming\JuliusSweetland). For me (with a username of Julius) the steps would be;

1. Close OptiKey if it is running.

2. Navigate to C:\Users\Julius\AppData\Roaming\JuliusSweetland (don't worry if you don't see the "AppData" directory, it is hidden by default. Just type the path into the navigation bar at the top of File Explorer).

3. You will see one directory in there called "OptiKey" - leave that. It contains your log files and customised dictionary(ies).

4. Delete the other directories. For me that means deleting "OptiKey.exe_Url_2dm1ifc0wqzcnmfgnsyhbssrcdx5zgbz", but your folder names will vary.

5. Start OptiKey again.
