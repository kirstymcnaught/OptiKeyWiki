##Type your first word

Run OptiKey and it will be displayed with a dark theme, position itself somewhere in the top left corner of your screen, and hover above all other applications. By default it uses your mouse cursor position for input and and selecting a key is performed by hovering over a key for about 1.5 seconds.

Try it out - move your mouse cursor over OptiKey and notice how the current key under your cursor is highlighted with a red outline. Keep the mouse cursor over a single key and you'll see an indication of your selection progress on the current key. This is a method of selection called "fixation" or "dwell" and requires you to keep your attention (the cursor) on each key for an amount of time in order to select the key. 

Complete a selection over a letter and it will be pressed and appear in the "scratchpad" at the top. You will also notice that some auto complete suggestions will appear above the scratchpad. Keep selecting letters to type a whole word, or select one of the auto complete suggestions to complete your word. 

If you make a mistake you can use the backspace key to delete your last selection:

or the BackMany key to delete the last whole word:

That's all there is to start selecting keys and typing words!
