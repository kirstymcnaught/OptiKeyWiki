A lot of AAC (alternative and augmentative communication) products on the market are outrageously expensive. I think this is unfair and a big problem. Everyone with motor and speech limitations should have access to suitable software. OptiKey is my contribution to help make this possible, but I am finding it increasingly tough to balance my full time job, family life, and ongoing work on OptiKey. I am not going anywhere, but if people are kind enough to support this project through sponsorship I will be able to dedicate more time to OptiKey. That means better and more frequent updates and more time spent finding and helping people in need.

If you would like to sponsor this project please visit: https://www.patreon.com/OptiKey

Thank you,
Julius
