A lot of AAC (alternative and augmentative communication) products on the market are outrageously expensive. I think this is unfair and a big problem. Everyone with motor and speech limitations should have access to suitable software. OptiKey is my contribution to help make this possible, but I am finding it increasingly tough to balance my full time job, family life, and ongoing work on OptiKey. I am not going anywhere, but if people are kind enough to support this project through sponsorship I will be able to dedicate myself more fully to this project.

If you would like to sponsor this project and help me dedicate more time to OptiKey please visit: https://www.patreon.com/OptiKey
