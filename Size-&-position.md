The position keyboard looks like this:

![Position keyboard with numbers](https://github.com/JuliusSweetland/OptiKey/blob/gh-pages/images/Keyboard_Position_Numbered.png)

    #1-8: Move OptiKey in selected direction by number of pixels shown on key #19
    #9-16: Move OptiKey by jumping it to the selected screen boundary
    #17: Toggle through a sequence which controls how many pixels to move by when using keys #1-8
    #18: Restore OptiKey to previous size (if maximised)
    #19: Maximise OptiKey
    #20: Arrange windows around OptiKey horizontally (above and below)
    #21: Arrange windows around OptiKey vertically (side by side)
    #22: Maximise all other windows (not OptiKey) - useful to restore the Windows 8 start menu and Windows Store applications to full screen
    #23: Return to previous (Menu) keyboard

**N.B.** When arranging other windows horizontally or vertically you may sometimes notice that a window is positioned correctly, but is not re-sized as you would expect. This is due to a restriction on the other window which prevents it from being made smaller than a specific width/height. Unfortunately there is nothing I can do about this as these restrictions are beyond my control.
