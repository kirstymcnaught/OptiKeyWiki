*Crash? Unexpected behaviour? Something else wrong?*

**Anti-virus programs can cause problems with OptiKey (and many other applications)...**
If OptiKey is crashing when you start it up then try temporarily disabling your anti-virus program and trying again. If that fixes things then try adding this directory to your anti-virus exceptions (folders the virus scanner will leave alone): 
**C:\Users\YOUR_USER_NAME\AppData\Roaming\JuliusSweetland** and let me know so I can work out a way to fix this!

If something else isn't working as you'd expect, you encounter a crash, a freeze, or something else horrible, then let me know by emailing me and I'll get it fixed for you. I need as much information about the problem as you can supply. Here's the ideal list of things your email will contain;

1. Logs. Developers love logs. You'll need to turn on 'Debugging mode' first (in the 'Other'tab of the Management Console, which is accessed by pressing ALT + M with OptiKey focussed). Turn that setting on then do whatever you did before to cause the unexpected problem, crash, or whatever it was, then close OptiKey. The logs are stored in a special directory which is personal to you. On Windows this will be (open File Explorer and find this directory);

**C:\Users\YOUR_USER_NAME\AppData\Roaming\JuliusSweetland\Logs**

Grab the latest log file (the modified date on the file will be the most recent) and attach it to an email to [optikeyfeedback@gmail.com](mailto:optikeyfeedback@gmail.com), but don't send it just yet! I also need...

2. A short description of what you were doing when the problem occurred.

3. What is the problem? A crash? OptiKey did one thing and you were expecting something else? 

4. Anything else that you think is useful. Screenshots are amazing.

I know it's a lot, but if you give me great info then it's much easier for me to find and fix the problem.
