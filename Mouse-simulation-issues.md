Mouse actions (clicking, scrolling, etc) can be impacted by certain keys, called modifier keys (Shift, Ctrl, Win, or Alt). If you are attempting to click/scroll/other mouse action and nothing/something unexpected is happening, then it may be because one of these keys is pressed and you have the Simulate Key Strokes key locked down (see ['Simulate a physical keyboard'](https://github.com/JuliusSweetland/OptiKey/wiki/User-Guide#simulate-a-physical-keyboard) for more). The mouse keyboard contains a section to show you the state of the modifier keys - you can release the modifier keys individually from the mouse keyboard, or return to the main keyboard and release the Simulate Key Strokes key.
