**Slowing everything down**

If you are finding OptiKey difficult to control because it is reacting too quickly (e.g. selections are too sensitive) then the main settings to change are:

1. If you are using the selection source of 'Fixations' (also known as "dwell") then you can increase the time it takes to complete a fixation (e.g. to 1.5 to 2 seconds). You can also increase the "lock-on" time which will require you to direct your attention to each key more deliberately before the fixation starts. Lastly if you are finding that your in-progress fixations are being discarded too quickly as your attention briefly moves elsewhere then you can increase the incomplete key fixation time to live setting. *See [Pointing & Selecting settings](https://github.com/JuliusSweetland/OptiKey/wiki/Pointing-&-selecting-settings) for more on these settings.*

2. If your multi-key selections are resulting in poor word suggestions then it may be that letters that you mistakenly direct your attention to are being included in the matching process. You can increase the 'minimum dwell time on a key to include in a capture' which means that you will have to direct your attention to each key within the multi-key selection for longer, which will reduce the chance of accidentally including letters you do not intend to include. *See [Pointing & Selecting settings](https://github.com/JuliusSweetland/OptiKey/wiki/Pointing-&-selecting-settings) for more on this setting.*

**Speeding everything up**

If you are finding OptiKey too slow because it is reacting too slowly (e.g. selections are taking too long) then the main settings to change are:

1. If you are using the selection source of 'Fixations' (also known as "dwell") then you can decrease the time it takes to complete a fixation (e.g. 0.8 seconds). You can also decrease the "lock-on" time which will require you to direct your attention to each key for less time before the fixation starts. Lastly if you are finding that in-progress fixations that you do not intend are hanging around for too long then you can decrease the incomplete key fixation time to live setting. *See [Pointing & Selecting settings](https://github.com/JuliusSweetland/OptiKey/wiki/Pointing-&-selecting-settings) for more on these settings.*

2. If your multi-key selections are resulting in poor word matches it may be that letters that you intend to include are being ignored because the threshold to register a letter is too high. You can decrease the 'minimum dwell time on a key to include in a capture' which means that you will have to direct your attention to each key within the multi-key selection for less time before it will be included in the matching process. *See [Pointing & Selecting settings](https://github.com/JuliusSweetland/OptiKey/wiki/Pointing-&-selecting-settings) for more on this settings.*

3. If there is a noticeable delay when generating multi-key selection suggestions, or word auto-complete suggestions then you can reduce the 'maximum number of dictionary matches' setting, which may speed things up. You can also turn off auto-complete suggestions. *See [Word settings](https://github.com/JuliusSweetland/OptiKey/wiki/Word-settings) for more on this setting.*
