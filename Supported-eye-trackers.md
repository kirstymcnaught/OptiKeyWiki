³ **N.B.**This tracker is not supported directly, but can instead be used to control the cursor position, which can in turn control OptiKey, as shown in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1M7FVBuMcec

OptiKey is designed to be used with an eye tracker, but you do not need one. You can control OptiKey with a standard mouse, or webcam ([see this page](https://github.com/JuliusSweetland/OptiKey/wiki/Using-webcams)) if you want to try it out.

Adding support for a new eye trackers may be possible - if you have an unsupported tracker then get in touch and I will see what I can do: [optikeyfeedback@gmail.com](mailto:optikeyfeedback@gmail.com)
