OptiKey is designed to be used with an eye tracker, but you do not need one. You can control OptiKey with a standard mouse if you want to try it out.

Adding support for new eye trackers is fairly straightforward. If you have an unsupported tracker then get in touch and I can attempt to add support for it: [optikeyfeedback@gmail.com](mailto:optikeyfeedback@gmail.com)
