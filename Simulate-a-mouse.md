OptiKey is able to simulate mouse input, meaning you can click, drag and scroll as if using a physical mouse. To open the mouse keyboard select the Menu key and then the 'Mouse' key (#4 on the menu keyboard).

The basic mouse actions (left, middle and right click, or scrolling - #1 to #4, and #7 to #14 on the mouse keyboard) are performed by:

1. Selecting the desired mouse action key (e.g. left click).

2. A large mouse cursor will be displayed to show where OptiKey is pointing. Direct your attention to the point where you wish to perform the mouse action and hold it there. A progress indicator will indicate that you are performing a selection. When the progress indicator completes your mouse action (a click, or scroll) will be performed at that point.

To increase your precision when making mouse selections you can switch on magnification by locking down the Magnifier key:

Selecting a point becomes a two step process when using the magnifier:

1. Direct your attention to roughly where you wish to click/scroll, at which point a magnified image of that area will be displayed.

2. Direct your attention to exactly where you wish to click/scroll in the magnified image to perform the action at that point (or select outside the magnified area to cancel the action).

Performing a Drag operation (#5 on the mouse keyboard) is slightly different as two selections have to be made after you select the drag key:

1. Select point one (this will be a two step process if the Magnifier key is pressed or locked down). This first selection will be where the mouse button is pressed and held down.

2. Select point two (again, a two step process if using the magnify feature) - this will be the point to which the mouse cursor is dragged and released.

The 'Repeat Last' key (#6 on the mouse keyboard) allows you to repeat the last mouse action taken, which can be useful if you want to scroll down a long web page one scroll at a time, for example.

*N.B. If you have the Simulate Key Strokes key locked down then keys #16 to #19 on the mouse keyboard show you the state of the modifier keys (Shift, Ctrl, Win and Alt) and allows you to release any which are pressed/locked down. If you attempt a mouse action while a modifier key is pressed then you may experience unexpected behaviour. For example clicking on a file in File Explorer while the Ctrl key is pressed adds the file to the current selection, rather than simply selecting the file.*
