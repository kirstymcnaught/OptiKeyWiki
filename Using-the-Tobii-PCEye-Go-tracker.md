**N.B.** I have not personally tested the Tobii PCEyeGo with OptiKey, but I have confirmation from some users that it works correctly. According to the Tobii website the PCEyeGo must be updated to firmware version 1.1.5 or later. Here are a few threads discussing this:

To upgrade your PCEye Go firmware email support@tobii.com, or follow these steps (taken from one of the links above):
* Firmware 1.1.5 for PCEye Go is now released as part of the Tobii Gaze Interaction Software 2.6.0 update. You can run the PCEye Update Notifier to update your system, or manually update by downloading the following file: http://www.tobii.com/Global/Assistive/Downloads_Training_Documents/GazeInteractionSoftware/Software/Tobii_Gaze_Interaction_Software_Enterprise_2.6.0.8.msi?epslanguage=en
* Once TGIS is updated, you will be prompted to upgrade the PCEye Go firmware on first launch. If it doesn’t, open the “System Information” tab and initiate the update manually.
